# Design Patterns
Most common design patterns for front-end development. Inlcuding their real-world examples.

## How to effectively use design patterns?
1. Understand the problem: Before using a design pattern, take the time to understand the problem it is trying to solve. Read through the pattern's description and examples, and try to understand the trade-offs and when it should be used.

2. Evaluate the use case: Once you understand the problem, evaluate whether the pattern is the right solution for your specific use case. Consider the requirements of your application and the constraints you are working under.

3. Be flexible: Don't be afraid to modify the pattern to better suit your specific use case. Design patterns are not one-size-fits-all solutions, and sometimes you may need to adapt them to better suit your needs.

4. Keep it simple: Avoid overusing design patterns or using them when they are not needed. Keep in mind the principle of "KISS" (Keep it simple, stupid) and don't overcomplicate your code.

5. Test and refactor: Always test your code and refactor it as needed. Design patterns are not a magic solution to all problems and you may need to adjust your implementation to make it work correctly.

6. Continuously learn: Read books, articles, and source code of other people, attend workshops and conferences, and join communities to learn more about design patterns and when to use them.
